JS Utils
========

What?
-----

This is a bunch of utilities that are not tied to the browser or the DOM which include:
* recursive eachr
* recursive mapr
* a pretty printer
* a linked list (list2)
* a stack: a weird thing that I haven't found a use for
* TODO possibly looking at adding:
    * a tree (based on the linked list)
    * a trie
    


Why?
----

There's probably no reason for you to be using this unless you are interested in the recursion or want a linked list or pretty printer.

This project is here to support other things I am working on that may be of more interest.
